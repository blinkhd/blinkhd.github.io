(this doc is being updated frequently with more cool stuff and methods.)
The documents below contain multiple links to web proxies and game sites. The first link contains every known link for each site, even the ones that are blocked. The second link contains only the ones that aren't blocked. 
If you don't know already, a web proxy is a website that allows you to view and use blocked sites.
Currently, these documents contain links to three different web proxies (Ludicrous, Fracital, and Rammerhead) and three different game sites (Extreme Math, Radon Games, and Google Math). There are multiple links to each site (for example, pioneersites.org and accidentreturns.com are both Ludicrous links even though the URLs themselves are different).
The third document below contains the Rammerhead links. Since there are over 200 Rammerhead links, I've decided to put them into a separate document. Because of this, I don't indicate which links are blocked like I do with the other sites. It's reccomended that you use Rammerhead instead of other web proxies because of the sheer amount of links, and because it's generally faster than all of the others.
Finally, there are some links that are blocked at school but not at home. There are more details in the first link below.<br>

Also, here's a good youtube client called Invidious that's generally faster and has multiple good features, such as allowing you to download videos directly. The link below will bring you to a table of a bunch of different Invidious links.<br>

EmulatorJS is a great retro game emulator that can run games from many systems such as NES, SNES, PS1, and N64. Here's the link:

you can get tons of ROMs from https://vimm.net, but it's blocked, so you'll need to access it with a proxy (rammerhead is the only one that works with it).
